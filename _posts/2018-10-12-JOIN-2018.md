* [Frederick Bousson: Unbeatable at Connect 4 with Wearables and Computer Vision](#unbeatable-at-connect-4-with-wearables-and-computer-vision)


# Talks & Workshops

## Unbeatable at Connect 4 with Wearables and Computer Vision by [Frederick Bousson](https://twitter.com/fbousson){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Frederick Bousson" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

The first sessions was held by Frederick Bousson about wearables.
Wearables are becoming mainstream .

Lots of glasses look like shit.

Eyes are very important to transfer information.
(90% of the information on the internet is processed via the eyes)

### Connect 4
Show what you can do with smart glass: connect 4

Found some code: Italian code

Found algoritm 2012 to calculate connect 4.
4 years ago: visual processing on top
3 years ago: ported to google glass
=> 3 different people built this open source logic and expanded on it.

### Image Processing
Reasoning in colour is a pain in the ass.
BGR vs RGB, lots of time lost.

Find objects, draw lines, find corners so the service can "see" the board.

Data is mapped to array.
To Minimax AI solver
(TODO: look at sldie about decision)
Decision tree and define the amount of positions it can think ahead.

Alpha-beta pinning: (TODO: check name) optimize if expected results are not good enough, no need to go deeper into the decision tree and cut off some branches to process.

OpenCV, Open Computer Vision, pretty performant

It is important to be create, as you must pass the information along about how to process the visual information
(TODO: retrieve a quote from the youtube stream)

Lighting is also very important and it can mess up your colour coding.

### Architecture
TODO: retrieve some info about the architecture from the slides

### Other examples of OpenCV
GTA self driving car
TODO: retrieve link to that dudes youtube channel

### Everything is possible
AR/VR can do anything
=> why is it not yet verywhere

#### Value Discovery
TODO: add the 6 steps of value discovery

### Takeaway
* Everything is possible
* Think before you act
* TODO: find more

### Questions
Biggest difficulties encountered?
* lack of documentation
* not all androids are the same, bad samsung Frederick has.
* finding colours is hard

How long did it take
TODO retrieve the answer again

## Testimonial TVH MyAssetPlanner by [Tom Verelst](https://twitter.com/tomverelst){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Tom Verelst" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

### TVH

TODO add some logos

TVH is a company
Split in Parts and Equipment

TODO: explain parts and equipment

### MyAssetPlanner

Tomorrowland rents 160 machines, which needs more then 300 calls to plan everything.

First a design sprint by [clockwork](https://clockwork.ordina.be/) 1 - 2 weeks, prototyping

1st version delivered after 2 months, already used 4 months.

Now 2 versions events vs industrial.


Development [spotify model](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/)
* autonomous squads
* do it yourself 

Event driven architeture: [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/), just consume what you need.

Lots of other stuff (TODO: add the image)

CI/CD [Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/), fully automated

Scrum Agile

Sprint Review
* Different stakeholders
* They receive a scenario and 1 person who is present for assistence, the stakeholder must go through the scenario themselves
* Lots of feedback


#### Live Demo
TODO explain the demo

### What is Next
Now we have 16, 17 customers on it, very soon this will scale up to 5%  which amounts to 3000 customers.
After that up to 20 000 customers.


## Visualizing Mandelbrot fractals using Riff and Spring Cloud Function by [Dieter Hubau](https://twitter.com/dhubau){:target="_blank"}

<span class="image left"><img class="p-image" alt="Tom Verelst" src="/img/join-2018/"></span>

After some late nighters

### Abstractions

TODO: add the image

IAAS, CaaS, PaaS, FaaS and SaaS

Less control to more business value.


#### Function as a Service
New on [Pivotal Function Service](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-function-service)

Open source project, base of Pivotal Function Service
This is Riff, create easily functions and move it to the cloud.

Initially used Zookeeper/Kafka to send messages between functions.

Google came to Pivotal with [Knative](https://cloud.google.com/knative/)
Knative runs on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)

Pivotal decided to switch to Knative and remove a lot of boilerplate needed to run Kafka and Zookeeper.

Knative has 4 components:
* Knative Serving: request/reply messages
* Knative Built: autodetect your code and create the required containers and sidecars.
* Knative Event: replaces Kafka and Zookeeper, provides channels and subscriptions.
* 4th Knative block: makes it run really well on Google Cloud.

#### Riff
New version was released 2 weeks ago.

Name comes from the guitar world

Lead is [Mark Fisher](https://www.twitter.com/m_f_)

TODO: retrieve the image about knative and Istio

* github: all is open source
* operators: TODO find explanation on movie
* developpers: make Knative resources
* [Istio](https://istio.io/): is used for sidecars; security, scaling, ...

### Live demo

Get Pods

Lots of different components, this is the unix way: do 1 job and do it good

### Mandelbrot
Most simple function which creates the most complex objects.

You can keep zooming, more calculations the deeper you go.

### The code

For 400 x 400 image we will send a request to the backend to calculate the results for every pixel
160 000, not the most efficient way to do the calculation, but this demo is about using functions.

UserContainer: actual container contains the actual function

InitContainer: they run before your container, you can use these to instantiate a database for example.

Dave Syer, talk about performance [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97UTDmonq7w)

For 1 function you need about 200 MB of memory.
It spins up a Spring Boot in the backend.

### What did we learn
* Not stable - brand new and state of the art
* Contribute - also by reporting issues (TODO add link to the jira/github issue tracker)

## Testimonial: HZIV by [Pieter Van Hees](https://twitter.com/pvanhees91){:target="_blank"}

### HZIV

TODO: describe HZIV

### What 

10 years ago HZIV wanted to rewrite the old applications running in Cobol.

Chosen technologies were Java 5 and Swing

This rewrite failed

### A new Start
Started anew.

Java 8/10
MongoDB
ELK

### Working @ HZIV

#### What is Great
Great freedom to choose and test out new steuff
Relaxed

#### What is Bad
Developper Anarchy
Some managers like micro-management, this does not combine well with frequent scope changes by the same managers.

#### Why should you want to work here
* Feels like a Spy HQ
* Home made rule engine
