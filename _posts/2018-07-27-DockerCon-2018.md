Moscone Center, downtown San Francisco. 
About five thousand people attended the 8th installment of DockerCon,
the biggest edition yet so far.

Compared to previous years,
there were no significant improvements to the Community Edition of Docker itself. 
Last year we had improvements like [multi-stage builds](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/conference/2017/04/18/DockerCon-Multi-Stage-Builds-And-More.html), 
or major product changes like [Moby and LinuxKit](https://ordina-jworks.github.io/conference/2017/04/19/DockerCon-LinuxKit-And-Moby.html).
This year,
however,
the event was mainly focused around Docker Enterprise Edition.
Docker for Desktop will be getting some new functionality, 
however!

## Generate projects using a guided workflow

Docker's goal is to keep everything simple.
A lot of developers are familiar with the basic Docker commands and Compose files,
but Docker wants to extend Docker for Desktop to all developers.
They want achieve this by eliminating the requirement to write Dockerfiles and Compose files.

A graphical user interface will guide you to set up container-based projects.
This user interface will be accessible straight from the Docker for Desktop menu.

The first workflow you can use is the 'Design application' workflow.
Using this guided workflow,
you can select services to add to your project,
and modify some basic settings like ports, version numbers and more.

Each added service will become a separate containerized application.
You can modify the Dockerfiles after they have been generated.
Next to this,
the generated project will also hold a Compose file,
which will allow you to start all generated services at once.

The second workflow is the 'Custom application' workflow.
This workflow uses custom made templates.
Difference with the first workflow is that you do not need to select individual services.
Teams will be able to create their own custom-made templates and developers can share them amongst each other.

<img src="/img/2018-07-27-dockercon/template.png" style="max-width:100%"/>

These features look promising, and will definitely help a lot of developers set up Dockerized applications.
Docker is also working on integrating Compose capabilities like secrets, volumes and networks into the guided workflow.
Finally, integration with CI/CD tools will also be implemented.
This will allow developers to deploy applications directly from Docker Desktop to Docker EE.

## Kubernetes and Docker integrations

Docker has been working on integrating with Kubernetes for quite some time now.

It is now possible to both run Docker Swarm and Kubernetes workloads next to each other on a DockerEE cluster.
When setting up a Docker EE cluster, Kubernetes and Swarm components are installed on every node.
Each individual worker node can then be set to Kubernetes or Swarm or in “Mixed” mode.
This will make it easier to mix Linux and Windows containers, 
as Kubernetes only has beta support for Windows containers,
while Docker Swarm fully supports these.

Docker now also integrated Kubernetes into Docker Desktop!
It was on the edge channel for quite some time,
but has now finally moved to the stable channel!
What does this mean? 
When using Docker Desktop, 
you can choose to run your applications on DockerSwarm,
or a local Kubernetes cluster!
Setting up a Kubernetes cluster locally has been made very easy.
With just a few clicks and a few minutes op setup,
and you have a Kubernetes cluster running on your computer!

Next to this,
Docker also integrates with your Kubernetes client.
It will show all Kubernetes contexts in the menu and you can easily switch them:

<img src="/img/2018-07-27-dockercon/kubernetes-context.png" style="max-width:100%"/>

Docker integrates with Kubernetes by leveraging the [Kubernetes API Extensions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/),
using Custom Resource Definitions.

Example, we can deploy a new Stack using a Compose file.
This will create a Stack resource in Kubernetes and will deploy pods and services in Kubernetes.

```bash
$ docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml stackdemo

Waiting for the stack to be stable and running...
 - Service web has one container running
 - Service redis has one container running
Stack stackdemo is stable and running
```
 
If we then take a look at what is running in Kubernetes,
we can see that there is a deployment, a replica set and other resources that were deployed using `docker stack!  
 
```bash
$ kubectl get all
NAME           DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deploy/ridis   1         1         1            1           5m

NAME                  DESIRED   CURRENT   READY     AGE
rs/ridis-85d4d69648   1         1         1         5m

NAME                        READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
po/ridis-85d4d69648-jx94k   1/1       Running   0          5m

NAME                     TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
svc/kubernetes           ClusterIP   10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP          29d
svc/ridis                ClusterIP   None             <none>        55555/TCP        5m
svc/ridis-random-ports   NodePort    10.101.242.155   <none>        6379:31248/TCP   5m
 ```

You can also see the stacks from the Kubernetes client:

```
$ kubectl get stacks
NAME        AGE
stackdemo   39s
```

How does this magic work?
Well,
if we go look at the API registrations,
we can see that is a Docker Compose API registration.

```
$ kubectl get apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io
NAME                                   AGE

...
v1beta2.compose.docker.com             29d
...
 
$ kubectl describe apiservices.apiregistration.k8s.io v1beta2.compose.docker.com

In the description of this API registration,
we can see there is a `compose-api` service running in the `docker` namespace. 

```
$ kubectl get service -n docker compose-api
NAME          TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
compose-api   ClusterIP   10.110.211.86   <none>        443/TCP   28d

compose-api   1         1         1            1           28d
```
